## About me
![About me](about.png)

For a long time, I have been working as biologist, but I understood that I love coding and making interesting features. Due to coronavirus quarantine, I was locked at my home and was coding day and night. I learned so fast that soon the result has materialized in form of my website https://bilinguator.com. Now I want to change my profession to web development. For this, I lost my job and started serious study in the Rolling Scopes School.
